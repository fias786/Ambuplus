## Inspiration
These days, Emergency Response times for Ambulances have hiked to a whopping **150%** with **Covid19** positive patients asked to stay home for more than 2-3 days. Patients dealing with real emergencies often are receiving their ambulances late. Every second matters, and we can‚Äôt afford to lose a life because of delayed emergency response times.

## What it does
Introducing **AmbuPlus+** ‚Äî a smart Ambulance service, which brings the nearest rescue squad to your home. You can also request blood from other users and blood banks. We have used Solace extensively in order to track Ambulances realtime. Ambulances push their live locations to specific topics which the backend subscribes to. The backend calculates the nearest Ambulance and matches the same when an user is in need. After this, the user‚Äôs application subscribes to the topic this ambulance is publishing its real time location to. We also confirm if beds are available at the hospital we might be going to & last but not the least it's supported by all devices above Android Lollipop!

**Expect fast, Worry less with Ambuplus+** üöë

## How we built it
**Ambuplus+** is crafted with ‚ù§Ô∏è. It's build on Android Native. We are using Solace's Pub-Sub for live-tracking of the ambulances and for initiating the blood request from the user end. We're also using Google Maps API to populate the info's of the same on the map viewport. The authentication of our app is being served via Firebase Authentication. And last but not the least, the chat server was deployed on a free dyno of Heroku. Our app is available in most local languages like Hindi, Bengali, Chinese, Korean, etc.


## Challenges we ran into
We took a lot of time configuring and refactoring the example code of the Solace. Moreover, we were also looking at the security side of the location which is a very important thing to be kept in mind for these types of projects. Also, it was a bit difficult for us to collaborate in a virtual setting but we somehow managed to finish the project on time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task initially but happily were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation.

## What we learned
A lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. Also not to mention, we enhanced our googling and Stackoverflow searching skill during the hackathon üòÜ

## What's next for Ambuplus+
We just really want this project to have a positive impact on people's lives! Still, we would love to make it more scalable & cross-platform so that the user interaction increases to a great extent :)
